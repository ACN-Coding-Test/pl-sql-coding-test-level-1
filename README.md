### Stage 1 - Table Design
Your task is to come up with an ERD (in `.png` format) and a DDL script in `.sql` format. Your requirement as follows.

  - User Management
    - This table need to have at least the first and last name of the user and a unique identifier of the user.
    - BW management also wants to know when the user is created and updated.
    - A user can be blacklisted and is not allowed to access the system. However, this can be restored on demand.
    - BW management forsee that there's going to be at least 100 users during the pilot program of the application, with possibility to reach a global audience with 100k potential users.
    - From the UI, management can search the user based on their first name and last name.

  - With the addition of country of origin, management are hoping to get a:
    - View of how many books per region
    - View of how many books per region per author
    - View of how many books per region per publisher
- Due to recent changes in database access operation, any data manipulation must be done through a store procedure or function.
